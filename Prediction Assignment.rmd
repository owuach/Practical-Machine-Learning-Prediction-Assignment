###Introduction
This document is being submitted as part of the prediction for Machine Learning Assignment 

###Background of dataset
>Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. 
>One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

### Assignment instructions
> One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.
> The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

### Excercise development
#### Setting up R

```{r, eval=F}
#Loading the necessary libraries
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rattle)
library(randomForest)
```


---

### Loading the Dataset
```{r, eval=F}
#In this section, the data files are downloaded from the Internet and loaded into two data frames. We ended up with a training dataset and a 20 observations testing dataset that will be submitted to Coursera.
# Downloading the training data
download.file(url = "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv", 
              destfile = "./pml-training.csv", method = "curl")


# Loading the training dataset
dt_training <- read.csv("./pml-training.csv", na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))

# Downloading the testing data
download.file(url = "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv", 
              destfile = "./pml-testing.csv", method = "curl")

# Loading the testing dataset
dt_testing <- read.csv("./pml-testing.csv", na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))

---

#Cleaning the Data
##In this section, we  remove all columns that contains NA and remove features that are not in the testing dataset. The features containing NA are the variance, mean and standard devition (SD) within each window for each feature. Since the testing dataset has no time-dependence, these values are useless and can be disregarded. We will also remove the first 7 features since they are related to the time-series or are not numeric.
---

features <- names(dt_testing[,colSums(is.na(dt_testing)) == 0])[8:59]

# Only use features used in testing cases.
dt_training <- dt_training[,c(features,"classe")]
dt_testing <- dt_testing[,c(features,"problem_id")]

dim(dt_training); dim(dt_testing);

#[1] 19622    53
#[1] 20 53

###Partitioning the Dataset
####Following the recommendation in the course Practical Machine Learning, we will split our data into a training data set (60% of the total cases) and a testing data set (40% of the total cases; the latter should not be confused with the data in the pml-testing.csv file). This will allow us to estimate the out of sample error of our predictor.
```{r,eval=F}

set.seed(1252018)

inTrain <- createDataPartition(dt_training$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE)
training <- dt_training[inTrain,]
testing <- dt_training[-inTrain,]
```

```{r, eval=F}
dim(training); dim(testing);
```
#[1] 11776    53
#[1] 7846   53

#Building the Decision Tree Model
##Using Decision Tree, we shouldn't expect the accuracy to be high. In fact, anything around 80% would be acceptable.

```{r, eval=F}
modFitDT <- rpart(classe ~ ., data = training, method="class")
fancyRpartPlot(modFitDT)

#Predicting with the Decision Tree Model
set.seed(12345)


prediction <- predict(modFitDT, testing, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(prediction, testing$classe)
```

#Building the Random Forest Model
##Using random forest, the out of sample error should be small. The error will be estimated using the 40% testing sample. We should expect an error estimate of < 3%.

```{r,eval=F}
set.seed(12345)
modFitRF <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data = training, ntree = 1000)

#Predicting with the Random Forest Model
prediction <- predict(modFitRF, testing, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(prediction, testing$classe)
```
